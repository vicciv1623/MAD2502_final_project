*Benfords law takes into account the first n digits significant digits, so if you have a number 0.00302, 
the first digit that would count would be 3, the first two digits that would count would be 30, and so on.

*benfords law is most commoly used with base 10, but teh law works for any base system higher than binary 

*applies to but not limited to, electribity bills, street addresses, stock prices, death rates, math and physical 
constants. benfords law can detect anomalies in accounting fraud, election results, public health datasets,
research datasets (e.g. biology), images (pixel intensity distributions), and more

*personally digital forensics, which is the one that tests for pixel distributions sounds like a really 
cool application

*examples: heights of hte 58 tallest structures follow benfords law, leading digit of 2^n also follow the law

*resources: https://github.com/carloscinelli/benford.analysis/tree/master (basically repo package to R package called 
benford.analysis) we can take reference to some of the cool features they implement 

*for analyzing pixels on image, we could use OpenCV or Pillow which are offered by python 
(i acutally did not knwo that for OpenCV but cool)
